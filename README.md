A list of solved and curated [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com) problems with solutions in ES5 and ES6 within the [StorybookJS](https://storybook.js.org) sandbox.

## Motivation

Initially my goal was to study a selected of core interview coding questions that would be asked of candidates in various software companies. Upon my journey, I landed with LeetCode. LeetCode is widely use in the industry and highest ranking among FAANG job seekers. Built around a substantial coding problem solving community, the convenience is the ability to run solutions against their test cases and search for advice from the community. However, I was unable to debug coding solutions that I've procured (locked behind their paywall). Thus, by creating this sandbox environment we can get right to solving and understand the code behind the scenes for free. Furthermore, this project will help with documenting problems and solutions, which is not only for my goals but for anyone who is mastering their coding journey. So get your pens or (I mean) fingers ready and let's get pragmatic!

## Foreword

Many people with software industry and computer science backgrounds would probably know that mastering and learning to code is similiar to a art form. There is no one correct or best way to study or learn how to code, but we all wish to become confident in our problem solving abilities of tackling various challenging problems efficiently. Thus, having a background framework of fundamental algorithms and data sturctures would be ever useful. The chapters of the book will provide sample code of data structures, as well as link sample problems that could be derived.

The collection of mine and a curated of many others who provided their solutions is free open knowledge under the MIT License. Feel free to fork and use this repository as your personal sandbox as well. A great way to learn to code is by debugging existing solutions and even implementing/testing on your own. I have no plans to implement these problems in other languages, so you may reproduce these solutions in the IDE of your choice, but what better enironment could you get than debugging and testing within the convenience of a web browser...
